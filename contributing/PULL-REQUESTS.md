## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches should have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    b. Provide a description of your changes.

    c. Put `closes #XXXX` (where xxxx is the issue number) in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**
